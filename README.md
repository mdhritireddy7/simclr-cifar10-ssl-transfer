# SimCLR on CIFAR-10: Self-Supervised Learning and Transfer Learning

This repository implements a full pipeline for self-supervised pretraining using SimCLR on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained without labels to learn useful image embeddings and is later fine-tuned (or linearly probed) for image classification.
